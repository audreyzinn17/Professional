Abstract:
The CHIME Outriggers will utilize Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to localize Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to 10s of milliarcseconds precision in the sky. 
VLBI relies on precise timing for such localization, which comes from clock stability. We measure clock stability by measuring the Allan deviation of a clock compared 
to a more stable clock over various timescales. The CHIME Outrigger at the Green Bank Observatory will utilize an onsite Hydrogen Maser for short timescales and a GPS
timing system for longer timescales. The GBO Outrigger will utilize a TM4 GPS, and we will test its stability by measuring its jitter over 1000s of seconds. An error 
of 200 picoseconds is allowed for CHIME requirements, corresponding to an Allan Deviation of σ_y(10^3) ≤ 2 * 10^-13, read to mean a root-mean-square (RMS) of 2 * 10^-13 
for measurements taken 1000 seconds apart. We will verify whether the TM4 meets this requirement. Additionally, we will use two other GPSs of similar quality to check 
the performance of the TM4: TM5101 GNSS and Leo Bodnar GPS. If it is found that the TM5101 and the Leo Bodnar are of comparable quality to the TM4, then they may be used
in future projects.
